Android-MOOP
============

Frontend for an Android Powered MOOP (Android Phone + IOIO Board) enables you to control 
rudder and sail position, as well as receive live data back from the boat. 

Please Note: This is very much a work in progress, the app will be refinded, with more features
etc added at a later date, I also intend to write a Java App that does the same.
